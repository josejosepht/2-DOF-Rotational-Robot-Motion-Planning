# 2-DOF-Rotational-Robot-Motion-Planning
This repository implements collision-free path planning for a 2-link rotational planar robot in a 2D workspace. It includes functionalities such as plotting the robot in the workspace, converting the problem into configuration space, computing distance transforms, finding paths, converting paths into configurations, detecting swept-volume collisions, and incorporating obstacle padding for conservative planning.
